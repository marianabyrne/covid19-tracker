# COVID-19 Dashboard (deployed on Heroku)
This is a final project for the subject of Data Visualisation, and consists of a dashboard to monitor COVID-19 information like number of cases, deaths, vaccinations and policies implemented. It's not perfect and we may come back to it someday :) The project was carried by Filipe Dias, John Ruiz, Mariana Byrne and Zhenghao Li.

The dashboard is split into two different tabs and because we faced some problems deploying the whole dashboard on Heroku, we had to split them into two Heroku apps. The Github associated to the Policy Response tab is: https://github.com/johnruiz24/covid-policy
The final dashboard can be accessed here: https://covid19-monitor-dashboard.herokuapp.com/
